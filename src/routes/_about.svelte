    "Okay, my name is Baba Ali. Iâ€™ve been around computers since a very young age, and have always
    been fascinated by the way software helps us solve problems and abstract so much away from us.
    This has inspired me to pursue a full degree in Computer Science, where I learnt the
    fundamentals of crafting high quality software. and I can help you build amazing web houses
    where you can invite your customers/clients to."
